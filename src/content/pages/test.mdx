# About The Lossless Group

The Lossless Group is a loose collection of innovators trying to find winning formulae for the Age of AI. 

## Less of Company, more of a Social Club

The Lossless Group is not an actualy company. It is a social club for innovators. 

When we are not Investing through VC funds, advising tiny startup companies, or eating tacos, we sometimes get asked to consult for large companies. This is the pseudo-brand under which we do that work.

Current Projects:

- Making pure Markdown a first class citizen for beautiful, content-rich websites using Astro.
- A "Content Farm" -- a universe of Obsidian plugins that give deep thinkers superpowers to put out content.
- A "Home Lab" playbook and toolkit to help make sure everyone can win in the Age of AI.

### Seeking Contributors

We are always looking for contributors to help us build out our content and our open source projects. If you are interested in contributing, please reach out to [Michael Staton](mailto:mpstaton@gmail.com).

The only constraint is we need to become friends. We are not looking for employees, we are looking for collaborators.
