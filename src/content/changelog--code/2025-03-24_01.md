## Added
- Robust error handling with retry logic for OpenGraph API calls
- Parallel processing for screenshot fetches
- Comprehensive reporting with clear statistics
- Utility functions for consistent report naming and frontmatter

## Enhanced
- Switched to plain text parsing for safer YAML handling
- Improved file safety with atomic write operations
- Added detailed function documentation and cross-references
- Updated report template with screenshot counts

## Fixed
- Screenshot fetch error handling and propagation
- Memory management for large directory processing
- File path formatting in reports
- Error tracking in statistics

## Technical Details

### New Utilities
1. `addReportNamingConventions.cjs`
   - Generates unique report filenames with auto-incrementing indices
   - Ensures directory existence with proper permissions
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_reportName_runIndex.md`

2. `addReportFrontmatterTemplate.cjs`
   - Provides consistent frontmatter formatting
   - Supports customizable fields with sensible defaults
   - Maintains proper YAML structure

### Core Script Improvements
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implemented parallel processing with proper tracking
- Enhanced error categorization and reporting
- Added comprehensive statistics tracking

## Impact
- More reliable OpenGraph data fetching
- Clearer error reporting and tracking
- Improved maintainability through documentation
- Better scalability for large directories

## Usage Notes
The script can be run with:
```bash
node scripts/build-scripts/runFetchOpenGraphData.cjs
```

Environment variables:
- `TARGET_DIR`: Directory to process (default: '../content/tooling/AI-Toolkit')
- `REPORT_OUTPUT_DIR`: Report output location (default: 'src/content/data_site')
- `OPEN_GRAPH_IO_API_KEY`: Required API key for OpenGraph.io
